# Skyways: DSA Flight Simulator

**Skyways: DSA Flight Simulator** is an innovative C++ project that brings **Data Structures and Algorithms** (DSA) to life through interactive flight simulation. Using advanced graph theory, it animates classic pathfinding algorithms—**Dijkstra’s, A*, and Bellman-Ford**—on a dynamic map with a user-friendly **SFML** interface. Real-time weather data from the **OpenWeatherMap API** intelligently reroutes flights, mirroring real-world aviation challenges. As a unique touch, Skyways generates a modern, web-based boarding pass with **HTML and CSS** for each booking. Perfect for students, educators, and enthusiasts, this project seamlessly blends algorithms, **UI** design, web tech, and real-world problem solving in a visually engaging experience.

## 🧠 DSA Focus: Data Structures & Algorithms in Action

This project is a showcase of advanced **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** applied to a real-world problem:

- **Graph Theory:** Airports and flight connections are modeled as a weighted graph.
- **Pathfinding Algorithms:** Implements and visualizes Dijkstra’s, A* (A-Star), and Bellman-Ford algorithms for shortest path computation.
- **Efficient Data Structures:** Uses adjacency lists, edge structures, STL containers (vectors, sets, maps), and priority queues for optimal performance.
- **Practical Application:** Demonstrates how classic DSA concepts power real-world systems like airline routing, especially under dynamic constraints like weather.

## 🚀 Why This Project is Impactful

- **Real-World Problem Solving:** Simulates real airline routing, including rerouting due to adverse weather, just like real-world flight operations.
- **Educational Value:** Demonstrates classic and modern pathfinding algorithms (Dijkstra, A*, Bellman-Ford) with live, visual feedback—perfect for students and educators.
- **Data Integration:** Fetches and uses real weather data (OpenWeatherMap API) to affect routing, showing practical API usage and real-time data handling.
- **Technical Breadth:** Combines algorithms, graphics, user interaction, and external APIs in a single, cohesive C++ project.
- **Portfolio-Ready:** A complete, visually engaging application that stands out in any portfolio or resume.

## 🛫 Project Overview

This project blends logic, real-world data, and visual presentation through two integrated modules:
- **Flight Booking System:** Search for flights, input passenger data, see dynamic pricing, and receive a stylish HTML/CSS boarding pass (saved in `output/`).
- **Flight Simulator:** Visualizes the chosen route, reroutes for bad weather, and animates the aircraft on a real map.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- Interactive terminal-based booking and flight selection
- Dynamic pricing based on travel date
- Real-time weather condition simulation and rerouting (OpenWeatherMap API)
- Pathfinding with Dijkstra, A*, and Bellman-Ford algorithms
- Animated, SFML-powered map visualization
- Generates a modern HTML/CSS boarding pass for each booking (in `output/`)
- Modular, modern C++ code (C++11+)
- Command-line and graphical launch supported
- Windows build-ready (all required DLLs included in `dll/`)

---

## 🧩 Components

### 1. Flight Booking (`flight_booking.cpp` in `src/`)
- Select departure and arrival airports (by code or index)
- View flight options for 5 days with dynamic pricing
- Enter passenger details and confirm bookings
- Generates a stylish HTML/CSS boarding pass for each booking
- Launch the simulator with selected route

### 2. Flight Simulator (`flight_simulator.cpp` in `src/`)
- Visualizes flight paths and reroutes for bad weather
- Fetches real weather data for each segment
- Animated aircraft movement on a real map
- User can choose shortest, cheapest, or fastest path
- Compare Dijkstra, A*, and Bellman-Ford algorithms

 **Note:** This module is designed to be launched from the booking system or with the appropriate input files/arguments. It does not work as a fully standalone application.

---

## 📦 Dependencies

- **SFML 2.6.2** (Graphics Library)
- **CPR** (C++ Requests, for HTTP)
- **nlohmann/json** (for JSON parsing)
- **C++ Compiler** (C++17 recommended)
- **Windows OS** (current build is Windows-focused)
- **OpenWeatherMap API key**

## 🛠️ How to Build and Run

1. Clone the repo and install dependencies (see above).
2. Run `compile.bat` to build the project. This will:
   - Compile all source files from `src/`
   - Copy all required DLLs into the `dll/` folder
3. Use `run.bat` to launch the booking system. This will:
   - Temporarily add `dll/` to your PATH so all DLLs are found
   - Run `flight_booking.exe` (or modify to run `flight_simulator.exe` as needed)

> **Note:** Always use `flight_booking` to start a new session. `flight_simulator` relies on data generated by the booking system and is not intended to be run independently.
